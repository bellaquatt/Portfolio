           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>Rhetoric is the art of persuasion through compositional techniques. When designing my projects, I try to think about how I can catch the users eye. I think one of the most important parts of design is that first look from the user. If they don't care enough to look at your design, then what's the point! Once the user is hooked, then they have to be persuaded to actually engage with the design. I like to use bold colors, unique design techniques, and platforms like the Adobe Suite to create my deisgns.  </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>You may be able to name some common design principles off the top of your head, but it's not until you see them used effeciently when you realize the impact of the design principles. Again, I really like to use bold colors as seen in my logos. I think they are eye-catching and fun. You can see the same thing in my 'Good Design' project. For that project, I chose the movie poster for 'Little Miss Sunshine'. This is one of my favorite movies and movie posters. I love the solid, bright, yellow background and decided to mimic that in the larger 'good design' image to catch the readers eye. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>The cartoon project is the project that comes to mind when thinking about our class workshop. Everyone in the class had very different techniques for how they would cartoon themselves. Although I was pretty happy with my design before the workshop, the workshop definitely improved my project. Having outside eyes allows others to see things that you may have not seen. I didn't notice it in my original, but my colors weren't very consistent and some were just plain inaccurate, making me look sickly. Seeing other peoples designs also opened my eyes to new ideas and techniques to apply to my own design.</p>

              <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
              <p>For the 'Good Design' project, I made multiple versions of my final poster with different colors, a different arrangement, different text sizes, because I just couldn't tell which I liked best. I ended up sharing with some friends and seeing which they liked and ended up on the design you see here. I took some elements from some designs and applied them to others. I think making multiple versions of my project helped me see in isolation what elements were working and what weren't.</p>

              <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
              <p>For the UX research project, we presented our research. I noticed as I was presenting that my project wasn't the most well organized. I had to click back and forth between some slides to see the comparison between my beginning result and end result. Watching others presentations gave me some better ideas on what to do next time. </p>

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p>For the second group of designs we worked on, we talked a lot about accessible, and what accessible design means. I tried to keep this in mind when creating these designs. That means making them readable, high contrast, and making sure I keep my audience in mind when creating my designs. For example, I tried to make my POGOH Ad poster design super readable, aligning the text to the left, high contrast, because in my mind, that would be seen by a large and diverse group of people. For the resume, it was definitely difficult to make accessible and I would say that mine isn't really accessible or usable for a job application. We were tasked with making a design resume though which is why it's much more unique and fun than any other resume. I would potentially send this to a small company where I know who will be reading this, or I would use it to post online for people to read. It definitely wouldn't pass any ATS systems.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
               <p>A design principle that I focused on a lot was space. Not over crowding the page with words or images, and not being afraid to have empty spaces. This is visible in all of my designs for this section. They are fairly minimalistic, have lots of open space, and minimal text. Typography was also a big one. I tried to be more intentional with the use of fonts. It may look simple, but I think each font matches its associated design really well. I'm happy with the font choices. For the POGOH Ad, the font was inspired by the font on POGOHs website. I also really like the font on the "GLRP" flyer, especially where it says 'Sign up today with the QR Code' I think the 'Q' looks good in this font.  </p>
     </div>
 
     <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p>For my GLRP flyer, I was essentially working with an entire class of students, as well as their professor. It was exciting to work with all of them, and a little scary to speak in front of them and lead discussions, but I enjoyed hearing their feedback. I also got to hear feedback from one of their actual guest speakers. Overall it was a really positive experience and I'm glad I got to work with them. Every single one of my other projects also went through in class workshops. For the POGOH add, I was difinitely stuck on parts of it, feeling like it was kind of empty, but my classmates gave me some good feedback on it and reassured me that it wasn't too empty, but actually looked like a POGOH add you would see.</p>

               <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
               <p>For the 'GLRP' project, It was a lot of back and fourth between me and Professor Marchi, and his class. It started with reading their assignment, to creating questions for the students to answer about what they would like to see on the flyer, to making a few designs, to presenting them to the class, making final revisions, and final presenting a final draft to them. It was really fun to work with everyone in the class and design something based on their needs. I made a design on InDesign and a design on Canva which came out completely different. There were things they liked on each one so I needed to take a few things from each to come up with a final copy.</p>

I think it was a really great learning experience for me, I rarely present in front of others. It was a little nerve-wracking showing my designs with them but we had a pretty good discussion about it. I think the in class practice we had was definitely helpful.   </p>

        <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
           <p>For the holiday gift guide, I wanted to organize it in a way that would actually make people want to look at everything on the guide. I tried to make it aesthetically pleasing by mimicing an art form called knolling. Where you arrange objects so they're parallel or at a 90 degree angle. I personally love when magazines do spreads like this, or just knolling in general. I thinkit makes people want to look at everything, especially if you have a short attention span like myself. You can scan your eyes across everything and if something catches your eye, then you can go and read about the details if you want.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
           <p>Again, I used a lot of spacing. Especially in my four-page and ten-page spread. I've started noticing that I definitely have a personal style. I think it's a little more minimalistic, I like when images dont have four straight edges in the middle of the page, if that makes sense, I want them to flow into the background. I also used a few different fonts in my ten-page spread. They are all pretty simple, but I think they work really well together. I like the compination of the bold, structured font, with the more flowy and feminine font.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
          <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
           <p>I presented my four-page spread in front of the class and was able to get some good feedback on it that helped me make some final decisions on my design choices. The class helped me decided on where to place my numbers in relation to the text at the bottom of pages 3, and 4, which was to place them diagonally to the words. Seeing other peoples work, their use of design principles, and other creative decisions was also inspiring. I liked sharing work with other people and also seeing their work because it makes me think outside of the box. I see things in other peoples that I didn't really thinkg I could do. For example, I find it really difficult to find a good place for images on a page, especially when they have concrete borders. I saw someones design where they pushed one of those borders to the edge of the page and I thought it looked so much better than just putting an image in the middle. I definitely utilized that technique in my ten-page spread. </p>

           <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
           <p>For my brand design project, I used three different softwares to try and make a logo. I used Canva, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Express. This ended up causing some problems because they all had different fonts in their library so I couldn't really start on one platform and move to another. I had different ideas though for what I wanted my logo to look like and found that some would be easier executed on certain platforms. To draw the logo that looks like yarn, I used Illustrator. My original intention was to actually make it look like yarn not just a red line but it wasn't looking how I wanted it to. I initial used Canva because they have more decorative fonts but ended up prefering a font on Express and Illustrator.</p>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
           <p>For the final project, the Brand Design Study, we presented in small groups. At first, our presentations were a little stiff, and I think we were scared of giving each other feedback or discussing things we like and don't like but as we went on we started getting more comfortable. I was the last in my group to present so by that point, people were asking questions, telling me things they liked or didn't and just generally advising me. It also started a conversation about my brand and I started getting new ideas there as well, on the general brand mission. I do like hearing what other people have to say, as well as see what everyone else in my group did. One of my group-mates dads is a graphic designer and hearing the things he was saying about her work were really insightful and definitely made me think a little more deeply about my designs. </p>
